# worldBank

The [World Bank](http://data.worldbank.org/) provides free and open access to data about development in countries around the globe


Jesse Piburn has released an R package, [wbstats](https://github.com/GIST-ORNL/wbstats), which has tools for searching and downloading it 

This is the basic code for an [interactive shiny app](https://mytinyshinys.shinyapps.io/worldBank/) providing tables, maps and charts on all 16,000+ indicators     


Please note that it is a 'one cap fits all' approach results should be treated with caution
